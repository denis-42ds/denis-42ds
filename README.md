## hello, reader ðŸ‘‹
<br>I am truly interested in finding patterns and connections in data,
automation of routine processes to free up human time.
<br>Some time ago, I came to the conclusion that 1C and Excel tools are not enough to implement full automation.
<br>I decided to try various training courses from a new field on different platforms.
<br>After I got to Data Science, I felt the need for an in-depth study of this limitless field, which is what I am doing now.
<br>I regularly try to attend conferences and webinars, read articles on Habr,
<br>subscribed to various channels, read books on this topic. I also take part in competitions on various platforms.
